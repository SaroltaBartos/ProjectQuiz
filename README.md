# World Capital Cities Quiz

This quiz is built using HTML, Tailwind CSS, and JavaScript, and deployed on GitHub Pages.

There are two versions of the quiz:
- A full set of **20 questions**
- A shorter, **5-question "quick" mode**

In the **5-question quiz**, the questions are selected randomly from the original set, so each time you play, the quiz will be different. This makes it a great tool for learning and practicing.
